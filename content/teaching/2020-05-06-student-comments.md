# The Big Idea

I sometimes get nice notes from students. I really like it when I do, since teaching and students are the part of the job that brings me the most satisfaction. I decided that I would save a collection of the nice things students say so I have someplace to look at them when things are tough. You can take a look, too, if you are so inclined.

## Spring 2020

*This was the COVID-19 Semester where everything went south throughout the world. I had to move my two classes online and figure out new delivery and assessment methods. I received some nice notes*

!!! note

I can confidently say (without any exaggeration) that, among all of my professors, you have made the most effort in helping us during the quarantine. Hope you're doing well.
