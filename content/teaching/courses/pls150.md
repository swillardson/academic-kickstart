**PLS150 Introduction to International Relations** 

*This is a required course for all of our undergraduate majors. I taught it during my first year, but then as department chair and (soon) one of the more senior members of the department I was tasked with teaching upper-level and graduate courses. After serving as department chair I taught this course again, this time as a large-enrollment course.*
