**PLS211 Quantitative Methods in Political Science** 

*This course was not required when I began teaching at NU, but most political science students took it.  We made it required starting Fall 2015 as part of the department's revised curriculum.  The course is meant to be a gentle introduction to statistics and their use in political research. Primarily it is designed to make students informed consumers of papers since many of our required upper-level courses use journal articles as their primary source material.*

[^1]: This was my first semester as department chair. We had lost our main methods instructor during the summer. We had a large cohort of 2nd year majors who needed this course as a prerequisite.  I was on a 1/1 teaching load due to my responsibilities, but I took on this extra course as well as 10 extra students.
