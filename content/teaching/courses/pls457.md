**PLS457/557 International Security & Conflict** 

*This course was the first combined undergrad/MA course that I taught and one of the first MA elective courses in our program overall. The course is a fairly standard conflict and security seminar. I wanted to focus on theory and give a broad overview of the field of IS and Conflict studies. I have taught the course twice. The course is meant to train our graduate students in writing and to broaden and deepen their knowledge in a particular area. For our undergraduate students, the class is meant to serve as a capstone course in which they apply the skills they have acquired in the PSIR major.*
