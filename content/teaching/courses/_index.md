Teaching is the thing that drew me into staying in academia after completing my PhD. I love working with students. My favorite interactions usually come 1 on 1 in office hours, but I love all the aspects of teaching. I often lecture, but I mix up lectures with break out activities, interesting writing assignments, and in-class simulations.
