**PLS210 Political Science Research Methods** 

*This is the first of the two required methods courses for PSIR majors. In this course the focus is on research design and writing in political science. I was serving as department chair in a department that was understaffed, so I taught double the maximum number of students the first time I taught the course so that our 2nd year students could stay on track with their courses.*
