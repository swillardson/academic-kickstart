**PLS455/555 The Politics of Arms in International Relations** 

*This is a fairly unique class.  It is a combined undergraduate/graduate course^[1] that is based off of my primary research interest. We discuss the ways that the sale of arms is shaped by and shapes internationan politics. I love teaching the course because sharing my research interests with the students keeps me excited and interested in the research topic overall.*
