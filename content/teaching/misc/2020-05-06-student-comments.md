**The Big Idea**

I sometimes get nice notes from students. I really like it when I do, since teaching and students are the part of the job that brings me the most satisfaction. I decided that I would save a collection of the nice things students say so I have someplace to look at them when things are tough. You can take a look, too, if you are so inclined.

## Spring 2020

*This was the COVID-19 Semester where everything went south throughout the world. I had to move my two classes online and figure out new delivery and assessment methods. I received some nice notes*

___
I would like to express my deep gratitude to you for amazing insights and real-life knowledge that I received from your classes throughout my years at university. I was privileged to know a professor like you. You have been an entertaining lecturer, a good listener and above all truly a mentor to us all. You are one of professors that made my experience at NU truly unforgettable and joyful. It is sad that I am not able to say all of these in-person, but I hope that in the near future I will be able to say thank you in-person.

I can confidently say (without any exaggeration) that, among all of my professors, you have made the most effort in helping us during the quarantine. Hope you're doing well.

I also wanted to wholeheartedly thank you for the support you provided to us during this whole period which was tough for you as well. Over my 5 years at the Uni, you became my favourity professor and I regret that I got an opportunity to register for your course only this semester. But at the same time, I am so extremely happy that I eventually used this chance. Thank you for the exciting four months!

## Fall 2019

*The note below is one of the favorite notes I've gotten from a student. The student government had a "candygram" day to send a note and candy to a professor. I was surprised and happy to receive such a kind sentiment.*
