**The Big Idea**

I sometimes get nice notes from students. I really like it when I do, since teaching and students are the part of the job that brings me the most satisfaction. I decided that I would save a collection of the nice things students say so I have someplace to look at them when things are tough. You can take a look, too, if you are so inclined.

## Spring 2020

*This was the COVID-19 Semester where everything went south throughout the world. I had to move my two classes online and figure out new delivery and assessment methods. I received some nice notes*


___

I can confidently say (without any exaggeration) that, among all of my professors, you have made the most effort in helping us during the quarantine. Hope you're doing well.

I also wanted to wholeheartedly thank you for the support you provided to us during this whole period which was tough for you as well. Over my 5 years at the Uni, you became my favourity professor and I regret that I got an opportunity to register for your course only this semester. But at the same time, I am so extremely happy that I eventually used this chance. Thank you for the exciting four months!
